## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Senior Software Engineer with 17+ years of experience in Senior Architect, Technical Lead, and Lead Developer roles. My core expertise spans distributed, multi-threaded software development for both on-premise and cloud platforms. I have led numerous successful architecture transitions and complex software development projects. My strengths include:

- Distributed, Multi-threaded Software for Windows platform (on-premise and cloud)
- Architecture & Design Patterns (Microservices, Pub-Sub, Active-Object, Strategy, MVVM, and more)
- Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Efficient and elegant code in C++11/17, C#, or any other language
- Applied Mathematics and performance tuning of algorithms
- Image Processing and Machine Learning algorithm development
- Advanced level C/C++ programming (multi-threading, multi-processing, instruction sets, parallelization)
- Unit Testing, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Performance-First, and Agile Methodologies

I am seeking opportunities that would further challenge me as an architect or hard-core developer, offering the "Joy of Creation."

## üöÄ Professional Experience

### **Philips**  
**Lead Engineer / Senior Architect** | *October 2011 ‚Äì Present*  
Bangalore, India

I have spent over 12 years developing distributed, multi-threaded software for the Philips Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS) in hospitals. Some key accomplishments include:

- **Cloud-Native Migration**: Led the architecture and migration of a cloud-native solution, covering cost estimation, performance analysis, and customer engagement. Transitioned from on-premise to a distributed microservice architecture, optimizing performance and scalability.
- **High-Performance Streaming**: Developed efficient streaming solutions for high-bandwidth data transmission and conducted POC studies for high-performance client viewing using WebAssembly.
- **Security and SSO**: Implemented security frameworks for microservices, including authentication, authorization (HMAC), DoS prevention, and Single Sign-On (SSO) using OpenID Connect.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced the proprietary iSyntax algorithm using AVX and SSE3 instruction sets, achieving significant performance improvements.
- **CI Pipeline & TDD**: Introduced Test-Driven Development (TDD) and established a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, achieving 85% code coverage and improving software quality.

Technologies: C++11/17, C#.NET, AWS (EBS, S3, RDS, ECS), RabbitMQ, Redis, F5 Load Balancer, SSE3, AVX, Windows
